# Global Development Standards (Archetype‑Agnostic)

These are organization-wide rules that apply to every repository and project, regardless of language, framework, or archetype. Language- or tool-specific files may add details and can override sections explicitly for their scope.

## Scope and Precedence

- Applies to all files in the repository unless a more specific instruction file overrides it (for example, Python/Java/Terraform instruction files).
- When guidance conflicts, prefer the most specific rule applicable to the file or technology in question.
- Keep changes minimal and focused; avoid broad refactors unless requested or strictly necessary.

## Core Principles

- Small, focused changes with clear intent and atomic commits
- Clean, readable, maintainable code with meaningful names
- Single Responsibility per function/module where practical
- DRY: prefer reuse over duplication; extract helpers when duplication appears 3+ times
- Deterministic, reproducible builds and tests

## Definition of Done (DoD)

Before you consider a task complete, ensure:

1. Functionality implemented with clear inputs/outputs and errors handled
2. Automated tests added or updated (unit for pure logic; integration for I/O). Target at least a basic happy path and one edge/error case
3. Documentation updated (README, comments/docstrings, ADRs if design decisions changed)
4. Security and privacy concerns reviewed (no secrets; validated inputs; least-privileged access)
5. Lint/format/type checks pass locally and in CI
6. Commit message concise and descriptive; PR includes context, acceptance criteria, and risk notes

## Testing Standards

- Write tests alongside code changes; prefer fast, deterministic tests
- Organize tests by feature or module; keep fixtures small and explicit
- Mock external calls and system boundaries; avoid network/filesystem unless explicitly needed
- Include at least:
	- Happy path
	- One edge/boundary case
	- One failure/exception path
- Strive for incremental coverage improvement; do not reduce existing coverage without justification

## Documentation Standards

- Update README or module-level docs when behavior, interfaces, flags, or environment variables change
- Use docstrings/comments to explain "why" when the "what" is not obvious
- Maintain ADRs for significant design or dependency choices
- Keep examples minimal and runnable

## Security and Compliance

- Never commit secrets, keys, tokens, or credentials; use secret managers and environment injection
- Validate and sanitize all inputs; use parameterized queries for data access
- Prefer least privilege for identities, roles, and API tokens
- Keep dependencies updated; run vulnerability scans and remediate critical/high findings
- Avoid insecure primitives: raw string SQL, eval/exec, shell with untrusted input, insecure random for security decisions
- Protect PII and sensitive data; log only what’s necessary and sanitize outputs

## Dependencies and Build

- Pin or bracket versions prudently to ensure reproducibility
- Prefer widely-used, actively maintained libraries
- Remove unused dependencies; avoid transitive bloat
- Keep builds cacheable; fail fast on lint/type errors

## Version Control and PR Hygiene

- Write atomic commits with imperative subject lines under ~72 chars
- Reference issue IDs where applicable
- Use branches for work; keep PRs small and focused with clear checklists
- In reviews, be kind, specific, and actionable; request changes with concrete suggestions

## Observability and Operations

- Use structured logging; include request correlation IDs at boundaries
- Avoid logging secrets and sensitive payloads
- Fail with actionable errors; include context for troubleshooting
- Consider basic performance characteristics and document any non-obvious tradeoffs

## Accessibility and Inclusion

- Write inclusive language in code, docs, and UI strings
- Ensure docs and examples are accessible (headings, links, contrast in images)

## Links to Organization Standards (Full URLs)

These resources provide additional, technology-specific guidance. Always use the full GitHub URLs when linking in docs or instruction files.

## Working with GitHub Copilot and Chat Modes

- Leverage repository prompts and chat modes when available for planning, security review, and test generation
- Reference prompt and chatmode files using the full URLs above when embedding links in Markdown
- Prefer minimal, targeted suggestions; validate generated code with tests and linters

By following these global standards, teams maintain consistency across repositories while still allowing language- and framework-specific instruction files to tailor the details where appropriate.
